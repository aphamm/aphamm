**A little about myself**

- I’m currently exploring RL fine-tuning + digital environments that bridge the gap between simulation and real-world robotics 🤖
- Pursuing long-term algorithmic real estate arbitrage - applying systems thinking to physical markets 🏠
- Worked at the intersection of efficient deep learning systems and creative generative models 🎨

**Research experience**

- [Creative Machines Lab](https://www.creativemachineslab.com) @ Columbia University with [Hod Lipson](https://www.me.columbia.edu/faculty/hod-lipson) 
- [Music Information Retrieval Lab](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/hmc-mir) @ Harvey Mudd with [TJ Tsai](https://www.hmc.edu/engineering/tj-tsai/)
- [BigML](https://baharanm.github.io/projects/) @ UCLA with [Baharan Mirzasoleiman](https://baharanm.github.io)

**Things I care about**

- My personal philosophy remains fluid but heavily influenced from: [non-dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism), [Michael Singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Alan_Singer) and Buddhism.
- Learning high-leverage fundamental truths about a field from people who can portray its beauty.
- Ultimate surrender to the forces of life - letting go of what I want and serving the same forces of reality that managed to create the entire perfection of the universe around me
